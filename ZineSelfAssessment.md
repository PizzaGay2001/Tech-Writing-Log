# Zine Self Assessment

Where are your strengths in terms of these skills? How did these strengths become evident in your project work? (This would be a good place to make specific references to your project materials.)
My strengths were in writing, research, and communications skills. I carefully wrote and edited my sections, did research on memes with Josh (memes were the topic of our Zine), and in class, I made sure to talk to Josh about what we were doing.
Where might you need some improvement and continued development? How is this evident in your project work? (Again, this would be a good place to make specific references to your project materials.)
I guess I need improvement in document design and fluency with digital tools. Based on how the lines didn't make good fold marks, I guess it wasn't desgned well. It came out crooked and messy.
What do you see as being some next steps for you in terms of these skills? Look ahead to the next project -- how might you take that project as an opportunity for growth and development?
I should plan better next time, and make sure partner and I are familiar wth how to use the design tools we're provided.

How would describe your collaboration for this project? What went well or seemed to work? Where did the collaboration breakdown? Why do you think this happened?
In class, Josh and I communicated as best we could. We told each other if we were going to do something different with the project so the other wouldn't be taken by surprise. However, our communication outside of class was bad. I didn't know he would be absent the day we were turning in our projects, and he didn't tell me he was having trouble making the video.
Let's assume that this isn't the last time you'll be asked to collaborate. Given your experience, how will approach your next collaborative situation? What will you be sure to try and do to be successful?
I will try to make sure we plan  better, so that our project will be a bit ore organized, and might turn out better.
Given all that you've said above, what grade would you give yourself for this project? How does this grade fit, or seem warranted, given your work the products produced?
B+. It wasn't perfect, but Josh and I worked hard on it, and did our best. We even made an original meme, using a picture I found on Google, as a visual aide on our Zine. However, we had problems with our video, and that"s why I wouldn't give our project an "A."
