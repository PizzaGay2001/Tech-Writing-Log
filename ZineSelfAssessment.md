# Zine Self Assessment

Research
Audience Perception
Communication Skills
Technical Skills
Writing
Document Design
Fluency with Digital Tools
User Research and Testing

In your self-assessment/reflection discuss each of these skills and how developed they are for you given your experience with the Zine Resource Project.

Where are your strengths in terms of these skills? How did these strengths become evident in your project work? (This would be a good place to make specific references to your project materials.)
My strengths were in writing, research, and communications skills. I carefully wrote and edited my sections, did research on memes with Alex (memes were the topic of our Zine), and in class, I made sure to talk to Alex about what we were doing.
Where might you need some improvement and continued development? How is this evident in your project work? (Again, this would be a good place to make specific references to your project materials.)
I guess I need improvement in document design and fluency with digital tools. Based on how the lines didn't make good fold marks, I guess it wasn't desgned well.
What do you see as being some next steps for you in terms of these skills? Look ahead to the next project -- how might you take that project as an opportunity for growth and development?

Also...collaboration...

This project asked you to collaborate with a partner. This is often one of the more difficult aspects of any work environment or task. Do some reflection on your work as a collaborator:

How would describe your collaboration for this project?

What went well or seemed to work? Why?

Where did the collaboration breakdown? Why do you think this happened?

Let's assume that this isn't the last time you'll be asked to collaborate. Given your experience, how will approach your next collaborative situation? What will you be sure to try and do to be successful?

How might we quantify this in terms of a grade...

Given all that you've said above, what grade would you give yourself for this project? How does this grade fit, or seem warranted, given your work the products produced?
