How useful is the site currently? (Be as specific as you can.)
It's kind of useful, but it's kind of narrow. A lot of the articles focus on Google services, and the non-Google ones seem to be geared towards students in STEM classes. I had statistics last spring quarter, so the Excel and WAMAP tutorials would've been useful to me. And I use Google to share work with my classmates and coworkers, and Word to write my essays. But other than that, there were not a lot of other programs on here. Like, there could be some tutorials on PowerPoint, Publisher, and Audacity.

How might it be more useful? (Again, specificity will help.)
Add some tutorials on programs that aren't on Pierce Hacker yet. For example, PowerPoint is used often in some of my other classes, so maybe some “PP tips and tricks” would be useful. Also, when I first open the homepage on my computer, I was like "Where are the tuorials?" It took me a minute to realize they were on a seperate page. Maybe making the tutorials the main page would be more useful.

Thinking hopefully -- what would this project site do/be if we really made it both awesome and useful? (Again...specifically...)
The site could include video instructions along with the step-by-step instructions, because people learn in different ways. Some people may prefer reading the instructions, but others would learn better from a video.

Select an existing tutorial/lesson on the project site. Try to find one that deals with a topic/skill you might actually need some support with.
Do an informal usability test on this lesson.
Write up your experience as a user. Does the lesson accomplish its goal? Was the goal appropriate? Too ambitious? Not ambitious enough? Where, if at all, did the usability of the lesson break down for you?
"Data Analysis with Google Suite." I perform a test on this 5tutorial using fake statistics, and it turned out pretty well. But maybe the writer could've included at least a link to a tutorial on how to convert the data into charts or graphs. And paid attention to the step numeration; almost every step was "step 1."
