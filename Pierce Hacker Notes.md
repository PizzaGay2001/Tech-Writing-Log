How useful is the site currently? (Be as specific as you can.)
It's kind of useful, but it's kind of narrow. A lot of the articles focus on Google services, and the non-Google ones seem to be geared towards students in STEM classes. I had statistics last spring quarter, so the Excel and WAMAP tutorials would've been useful to me. And I use Google to share work with my classmates and coworkers, and Word to write my essays. But other than that, there were not a lot of other programs on here. Like, there could be some tutorials on PowerPoint, Publisher, and Audacity.

How might it be more useful? (Again, specificity will help.)
Add some tutorials on programs that aren't on Pierce Hacker yet. For example, PowerPoint is used often in some of my other classes, so maybe some “PP tips and tricks” would be useful.

Thinking hopefully -- what would this project site do/be if we really made it both awesome and useful? (Again...specifically...)

Select an existing tutorial/lesson on the project site. Try to find one that deals with a topic/skill you might actually need some support with.
Do an informal usability test on this lesson.
Write up your experience as a user. Does the lesson accomplish its goal? Was the goal appropriate? Too ambitious? Not ambitious enough? Where, if at all, did the usability of the lesson break down for you?
