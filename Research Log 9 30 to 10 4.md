# Tech Writing - Research Log 9 30 to 10 4

Describe your own initial understandings and assumptions about "technical writing" as you start the course. How do your initial understandings/assumptions align (or not) with the work we have done so far?
I knew that technical writing had to do with instructions and coding. So far the work we've done sort of aligns with these understandings.

Reflect on your experience in composing these instruction sets -- attempt to describe all of the choices you made in the process of realizing your composition. In light of our usability testing -- what, if anything, would you revise or change about your instruction set in order to improve it?
I used 14 pieces to make my Lego garden, and used a Powerpoint (with a video) to make the instructions for making the garden. Thinking back, I probably should've had someone else hiold the camera, and maybe run a Sharpie over the pieces that blended into the flat piece.

Technical Writing -- like any field or category of writing -- is rhetorically situated. That means that questions of audience are essential considerations to what's produced. Even though this is a classroom exercise -- what sense of audience for these instructions do you have? How, if at all, has this sense of audience -- that you are designing this text for a reader -- infromed the choices you made in producing the composition?
Almost everyone (unless I'm under or overestimating some people's ages) in the class is older than me. But I've always consider myself more mature than other people my age, so I presented the instructions in a way someone in their twenties or thirties would've done.

I have left it up to you as to how you deliver your instructional text to your audience. You could choose Word, PowerPoint, HTML or any number of mediums or platforms. How did you decide to deliver your composition and what factors motivated that choice? Ultimately, what do you think your choice of delivery medium/platform get you as a writer?
I cbhose PowerPoint because I've always trusted PowerPoint as a way of presenting information. As for the video, that was for a single step, but I only made the video because said step is tricky, and I wanted people to see a demonstration.

Describe and reflect on your work in setting up an account and repository on GitHub. The "Hello World" tutorial/guide on GitHub is an example of tech writing. What did you notice about it? Perhaps more importantly, what might you learn from it? What's at least one thing you might take away from the GitHub "Hello World" tutorial that you could apply to your own instructional set in order to improve it?
I have to say, that this is a new expirience for me, but I think I'm going to have fun with Github. I learned about branching and "pulling" so far, and I'm sure I'll learn more as time goes by.

Finally, what do you think you learned this week? Keep in mind that your learning might resonate with particualr course outcomes or personal outcomes or even something unexpected or not entirely anticipated by either articualted course or personal outcomes.
This week, I started collaborating with classmate Josh on a Zine. It's been a while since I've done a group project, but I hope we work well together.
