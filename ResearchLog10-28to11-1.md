My first source is from *US News and World Report Education:* "5 Must-Have Tech Skills for College Students." Basically, the article says that typing ability, online etiquette, software suite basics, online research skills, and privacy/security awareness.
These skill are important to know as the digital world is evolving, because more employers and college are turning to technology for their workspace and resources. We need to be safer and smarter online. Privacy is a top safety priority. You need to be very careful what you post online.
